# TheWay: List Changes

## Locate the home

Run `theway path` and use the folder it prints as `<home>`, never a path from elsewhere: TheWay files are stored in `<home>/<project>/`, where `<project>` is the current directory name.
- If `theway` is not found, tell the user to add the folder theway is installed in (`~/.local/bin` by default) to their `PATH`, or to run `npx --yes @pixelfactoryio/theway@latest install` then `/reload-plugins`, and stop.
- If any `theway` subcommand fails with `error: unknown command '<name>'`, the installed `theway` is older than these commands: tell the user to run `npx --yes @pixelfactoryio/theway@latest install` then `/reload-plugins` and stop.
- If a `theway` subcommand exits 1 otherwise, quote the error line it wrote to stderr and stop, unless the step that runs it says what to do instead. Not every error line starts with `theway:`: `validate-id` writes `invalid change id '…'` and `archive` writes `Error: …`.
- Quote every `theway: warning:` line in your report.
- Do not check for files under `<home>` before reading them. If a file under `<home>/standards/` or `<home>/templates/` does not exist, theway is not set up: tell the user to run `npx --yes @pixelfactoryio/theway@latest install` then `/reload-plugins` and stop.
